# Study Notes: Of Religion and War

## The Great Awakening

- **Context**: Religious debates were common in 18th-century America, especially among New England colonists who felt their faith had weakened.
- **Key Figure**: Increase Mather, a prominent minister, suggested that colonists had come to America to test their faith.
- **The Great Awakening**: A religious revival that began in the 1730s and spread to various Protestant denominations across the 13 colonies (e.g., Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists).
- **Jonathan Edwards**: A key preacher in Massachusetts, known for his famous sermon _“Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.”_ His intense preaching style caused physical convulsions in his congregation.
- **George Whitefield**: An itinerant preacher whose dramatic style and calls for heartfelt, personal faith attracted large crowds across the colonies, making the Great Awakening a widely popular movement.

### Key Outcomes of the Awakening:

- **Religious Impact**: The revival encouraged self-reflection and personal religious experiences, weakening the authority of established churches.
- **Social and Political Implications**: It fostered a language of individualism that would later influence political independence movements.

## Religious Tensions and Colonial Divisions

- **New Lights vs. Old Lights**: The religious revival led to divisions within the church. "New Lights" supported the emotional revivals, while "Old Lights" rejected them as excessive.
- **Lasting Influence**: Although the revivals faded by the 1760s, they helped lay the groundwork for questioning authority, including religious and political systems. This spirit of individualism would contribute to the rise of republican ideals.

## The Seven Years' War (French and Indian War)

- **Conflict**: Fought between the British (Protestants) and the French (Catholics), with both sides supported by various Native American allies. The war began in 1754 and ended in 1763 with the British gaining control of much of Canada and North America.
- **Impact on Colonists**:
  - **Religious Influence**: The war reinforced anti-Catholic sentiment among Protestants, particularly as the British celebrated the defeat of Catholic France.
  - **Tensions within the Empire**: The war revealed divisions within the British Empire, particularly around religion, language, and national origin.

## Pontiac's War

- **Indigenous Resistance**: Native American leader Pontiac, inspired by the teachings of the prophet Neolin, led an uprising against British forces after the Seven Years' War.
- **Results**: Although the Native Americans did not win, they forced the British government to change its policies, including the _Royal Proclamation of 1763_, which restricted Anglo-American settlement beyond the Appalachian Mountains and sought to protect Native American lands, and helped limit the wars with Native Americans.

## The Aftermath and Shifting Identities

- **Post-War Discontent**: The British government's attempts to control the colonies through acts and policies, including the Proclamation Line, angered colonists, especially those in the Ohio River Valley.
- **Emerging American Identity**: In response to British policies, colonists began to define themselves more distinctly as Americans, rather than as British subjects. This shift in identity was reflected in the writings of Michel-Guillaume-Saint-Jean de Crèvecoeur, who described Americans as a "new man"—self-reliant and free from European class systems.
- **Colonial Unity**: The Seven Years' War united the colonies politically and culturally, as seen in efforts like Benjamin Franklin’s Albany Plan of Union (1754) and the collective military efforts during the war.

### Conclusion:

- The **Seven Years’ War** and the **Great Awakening** both played critical roles in shaping American identity. While the Great Awakening fostered a spirit of individualism and religious reform, the war helped unify the colonies politically and set the stage for growing discontent with British rule, ultimately leading to the American Revolution.

# Study Notes: Conclusion of Colonial Society

# Summary of Colonial Life and Early Resistance

- By **1763**, colonial life had undergone significant change and transition. The settlers had experienced many developments since their arrival.
- **Unity**: By this time, Americans had never been more united. They fought and celebrated together, but also recognized that they were not considered full British citizens. Instead, they were something else.

## Growing Tensions and Reforms

- **Imperial Reforms**: Many Americans viewed British reforms as threats to their **liberties**â€”rights they considered their birthright as British subjects.
- **The Stamp Act Congress (1765)**: This was a critical event where colonial leaders came together to oppose Parliament-imposed taxes.
  - The leaders universally agreed that the taxes were unfair and responded by **boycotting British goods**.
  - This protest created a **shared narrative** of sacrifice and resistance, leading to a growing sense of **political identity**.

## A New Political Identity

- As the colonists resisted British policies, their shared actions led them to question whether they were truly British after all. The **seeds of rebellion** were beginning to take root.

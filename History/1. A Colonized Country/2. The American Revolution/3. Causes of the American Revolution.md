# Causes of the American Revolution

---

## **Summary**

The American Revolution arose from growing tensions between Britain and its American colonies, driven by postwar reforms, taxation policies, and colonial resistance. Britain’s attempts to assert control and generate revenue after the Seven Years’ War led to widespread unrest. Key turning points included the **Stamp Act**, **Townshend Acts**, and resistance movements such as boycotts, riots, and nonimportation agreements. Colonial dissatisfaction was fueled by concerns over representation, economic hardship, and perceived violations of their rights.

## **Key Causes**

### **Post-Seven Years’ War Context**

- **British Expansion**: Victory granted Britain vast territories, including North America east of the Mississippi and India.
- **Economic Burden**: War doubled Britain’s national debt, prompting efforts to raise revenue and tighten control.
- **Proclamation of 1763**: Limited colonial expansion west of the Appalachian Mountains to prevent conflicts with Native Americans, sparking colonial protests.

### **Economic and Political Reforms**

1. **Sugar Act (1764)**:

   - Reduced molasses duty but increased enforcement.
   - Smugglers tried without jury trials.
   - Created fears of escalating taxes and loss of liberties.

2. **Currency Act (1764)**:
   - Restricted colonies from printing paper money, worsening the postwar recession.

### **The Stamp Act (1765)**

- **Tax Scope**: Required stamps on documents like newspapers, legal papers, and playing cards, creating a new direct tax.
- **Resistance**: Resistance to the Stamp Act took three forms. It was divided largely by class. There was legislative resistance by elites. There was economic resistance by merchants. And there was popular protest by common colonists.
  - **Legislative Resistance**: Elite-led resolutions, e.g., _Virginia Resolves_.
  - **Economic Resistance**: Merchants’ nonimportation agreements pressured Parliament.
  - **Popular Protests**: Riots, destruction of officials’ property (e.g., Andrew Oliver), and formation of the _Sons of Liberty_.
- **Outcome**:
  - Stamp Act repealed (1766) but replaced with the _Declaratory Act_, asserting Parliament’s authority over colonies.
  - Britain made another attempt to draw revenues from the colonies and did so with the Townshend Acts

### **Townshend Acts (1767)**

- **New Duties**: Taxed imports like lead, glass, paint, and tea.
- **Colonial Reaction**:
  - Seen as a revenue-raising scheme, not trade regulation.
  - Renewed nonimportation and nonconsumption agreements.
  - Promoted use of homespun clothing and local goods.

## **Conclusion**

The Revolution's roots lay in British reforms following the Seven Years’ War, colonial resistance to taxation and governance, and the cultural shift toward unity and independence. Each new policy, met with escalating protests, laid the groundwork for revolution.

## **The Boston Tea Party and Early Revolutionary Events**

### **Background**

- Post-Boston Massacre, tensions eased, and the colonial economy improved.
- In 1773, Britain passed the **Tea Act**:
  - Aimed to aid the East India Company, which was in financial distress.
  - Allowed the company to sell tea directly to the colonies, bypassing merchants.
  - Tea was cheaper, but the tax implied colonial acceptance of British taxation rights.
- Colonists, especially merchants, resisted due to fears of monopolies and taxation precedents.

### **The Event**

- December 16, 1773: The **Sons of Liberty**, led by Samuel Adams and John Hancock, disguised as Mohawks, boarded ships in Boston Harbor.
- They dumped **342 chests of tea** into the water to protest British taxation.
- The action, called the **Boston Tea Party**, inspired similar protests in Charleston, Philadelphia, and New York.

### **Aftermath**

- Britain responded with the **Coercive Acts** (1774), known by colonists as the **Intolerable Acts**:
  1. **Boston Port Act**: Shut down Boston Harbor.
  2. **Massachusetts Government Act**: Placed the colony under direct British control.
  3. **Administration of Justice Act**: Allowed royal officials to be tried in Britain.
  4. **Quartering Act**: Permitted British soldiers to be housed in private homes.
- These acts united the colonies, fostering a shared sense of identity and resistance.

- The militia (including **Minutemen**) resisted:
  - First shots fired at Lexington Green.

## **Toward Independence**

### **The Declaration of Independence**

- **Drafted by Thomas Jefferson**, edited by John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Congress.
- Adopted on **July 4, 1776**.
- Key elements:
  - Preamble invoking **natural law**: "All men are created equal... endowed with unalienable rights."
  - List of grievances against British rule, including taxation and governance reforms.
- Initially included criticism of the slave trade, later removed due to opposition from South Carolina and Georgia. So did those from northern states who profited from the trade.

# The Paradox of the American Revolution

---

## Initial Loyalty to Britain

- In the **1760s**, many North American colonists, like **Benjamin Rush** from Philadelphia, felt a deep emotional loyalty to the **British monarchy**.
  - Rush described a visit to the House of Lords as a **sacred experience**, feeling reverence for the British throne.
  - Colonists had just helped Britain win a world war and felt pride in being part of the British Empire.

## The Shift Toward Revolution

- By **1763**, it would have seemed highly improbable that the same colonists would **declare independence** from Britain in just over a decade.
- The **American Revolution** was driven by new ideas about liberty and governance, creating ideals that would define **American identity**.

## Paradoxes of the Revolution

The American Revolution was **paradoxical** and **unpredictable**:

1. **Fight for Liberty, Yet Slavery Persisted**: The Revolution was fought in the name of **freedom**, yet it did not end **slavery**.
2. **Resistance to Centralized Authority, Yet Closer Unity Among Colonies**: While there was resistance to strong central authority, the war led to the colonies forming **closer ties** and creating new governments.
3. **Republican Selflessness vs. Personal Gain**: Revolutionaries aimed to create a government based on **republican selflessness** for the public good, but the Revolution also encouraged **individual self-interest**.
4. **Fight for Independence, Not Democracy**: The Revolution secured **independence** from Britain, but the leaders did not fight to create a **democracy**.

## The Role of Common Colonists

- The **"founding fathers"** led the revolution, but it was the involvement of **ordinary colonists** that turned the tide.
  - **Common people** played a key role in the Revolution, often pushing for changes that **elite leaders** were not prepared for or welcomed.
- The forces unleashed by common colonists during the Revolution continued to shape the nation long after the war, impacting **American history** to the present day.

## Conclusion

- The **American Revolution** created ideals of liberty, self-governance, and independence, but also left unresolved contradictions and tensions that have shaped America's development.

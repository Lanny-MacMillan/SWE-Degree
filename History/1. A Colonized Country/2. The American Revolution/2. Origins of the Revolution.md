## Long-Term Causes of the American Revolution

---

### **Background Context**

The **American Revolution** had both **long-term** and **short-term causes**. The long-term causes include political, cultural, and economic developments in the **18th century** that set the stage for the crisis of the **1760s and 1770s**.

### 1. Britain's Lack of Clear Policy (1600s-1700s)

- Between the late **1600s** and the mid-**1700s**, Britain failed to define its relationship with the colonies and lacked a clear program for government reform.
- **Two major factors** contributed to this failure:
  1. **Constant warfare**: Britain was engaged in wars, like the **War of the Spanish Succession** and the **Seven Years' War**, making it hard to focus on colonial affairs.
  2. **Conflicting visions of empire**:
     - **Old Whigs**: Favored an **authoritarian empire** with territorial conquest and higher taxes to reduce national debt.
     - **Patriot Whigs**: Argued for trade and manufacturing over land and resources, opposing authoritarian rule and advocating for the colonies' **equal status** with Britain.

### 2. Colonists' Beliefs and Salutary Neglect

- **Colonists' outlook**: Colonists believed they were entitled to the same rights as British subjects and enjoyed the benefits of **salutary neglect** (a hands-off approach from Britain).
- **James Otis Jr. (1764)** expressed the colonists' outlook. He wrote, “The colonists are entitled to as ample rights, liberties, and privileges as the subjects of the mother country are, and in some respects to more.”
- By the mid-1700s, the colonies had developed a **sense of independence** due to their economic success under Britain’s non-interference.

### 3. Development of Colonial Political Systems

- **Local assemblies**: Colonies created their own **assemblies**, similar to the **British Commons**, to handle taxation, revenue, and royal salaries.
- **Colonial political culture**: Colonists increasingly saw their assemblies as having the same rights as **Parliament**. British inaction seemed to support this view.
- **Political culture differences**: The colonies' **political culture** differed from Britain’s, with a larger proportion of men participating due to easier access to land. **Republicanism** emphasized self-governance, virtue, and the public good.

### 4. The Influence of Enlightenment and the Great Awakening

- **Enlightenment**:
  - **John Locke’s philosophy**: Locke argued that people are not born superior but are shaped by their environment, including wealth and education. His ideas promoted **education** and the **questioning of authority**.
  - Locke's ideas led to a shift in colonial thinking, encouraging colonists to **think for themselves** and challenge traditional authority.
- **Great Awakening**:
  - **George Whitefield’s sermons (1739-1740)**: Whitefield preached emotional revivals, emphasizing **personal salvation** and direct relationships with God, bypassing the authority of ministers.
  - This led to religious **splits in congregations** and empowered people to **question authority** in both religious and political contexts.
- Both John Locke and George Whitefield had empowered people to question authority.

### 5. Anglicization and Cultural Similarities to Britain

- As colonial economies grew, **Anglicization** became more common:
  - Colonists began purchasing **British goods**, such as **fashion** and **housewares**, emulating British culture.
  - Colonists with means also sought to enjoy **British liberties**, creating tension between their desires for British goods and the political freedoms they increasingly demanded.

---

### 6. Tensions and the Seven Years' War

- After the **Seven Years' War**, Britain sought to implement **imperial reforms** to recover from war debt. These reforms conflicted with the colonists’ growing sense of **autonomy** and their understanding of their role in the British Empire.

## Conclusion

Long-term political, cultural, and economic factors in the **18th century** helped shape colonial attitudes and set the stage for the **American Revolution**. Colonists' growing belief in their **rights** and desire for **independence** were influenced by philosophical ideas, religious revivals, and economic growth, all of which came into conflict with British policies after the **Seven Years' War**.

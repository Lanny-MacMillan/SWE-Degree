# Study Notes: Colonial Governors and Society

## Colonial Governors and Political Structures

### **Colonial Political Categories**

- **Provincial Colonies**
  - **Examples**: New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia
  - **Description**: Most tightly controlled by the British Crown. Governors were appointed by the King.
- **Proprietary Colonies**

  - **Examples**: Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland
  - **Description**: Owned by **lord proprietors** who appointed governors. These colonies often had more freedoms than others.

- **Charter Colonies**
  - **Examples**: Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut
  - **Description**: Most complex system of government, with executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Governors were elected from among property-owning men.

### **Councils and Assemblies**

- **Council**: Governor's cabinet, consisting of prominent local figures (e.g., militia heads, attorneys general). Appointed by the governor but sometimes approved by Parliament.
- **Assembly**: Elected body of property-owning men who ensured that colonial laws followed English laws. They also checked the governor’s power, approved taxes, and budgets.
  - **Civic Duty**: Assemblies grew from the idea that men should support the government through voting, taxes, and militia service.
  - **Social Contract**: Government is created by the people. Influenced by philosophers like Hobbes and Locke.
  - **Equality**: While wealthy men controlled politics, there was a belief in equality before the law. The application of this equality to African Americans, Native Americans, and women was unclear.

## Marriage in Colonial America

### **Family Life**

- **Differences from Europe**: Colonial families had access to land and resources, encouraging earlier marriages and larger families.
- **Shift in Family Dynamics**: By the late 1700s, families became smaller, and wives gained more autonomy. Romantic love began to be seen as a key aspect of marriage, rather than just an economic partnership.

  - **Example**: John Fenno and his wife Mary Curtis Fenno exemplified the "companionate ideal," with deep emotional affection.

### **Marriage Challenges**

- **Slavery**: Enslaved people had informal marriages, as their unions were not legally recognized.
- **Coverture**: White women lost political and economic rights to their husbands under common law.
- **Divorce and Abandonment**: Divorce rates increased in the 1790s. **"Elopement notices"** were common in newspapers, where people blamed their spouses for misbehavior.
- **Violence in Marriages**: Domestic violence was widespread. Wives sometimes reported violent incidents, such as threats with weapons.

## Print Culture in Colonial America

### **Definition**

- **Print Culture** refers to the processes and factors influencing the production of printed materials, including:
  - Relationship between **authors** and **publishers**.
  - **Technical constraints** faced by printers.
  - The **tastes of readers**.
- Colonies experienced **regional differences** in print culture but all faced challenges such as **censorship** and **imperial control**.

### **Regional Differences**

- **Virginia**: Printing was discouraged, with Governor **Sir William Berkeley** stating that printing caused "disobedience" and "heresy."
- **Chesapeake**: Lack of stable printing trade until **William Parks** opened a printing shop in Annapolis in **1726**.
- **New England**: Had a strong respect for print from the start, particularly among Puritans. Key early publications included:
  - **Bay Psalm Book** (1640).
  - **First Bible printed in America** (1660), by **Samuel Green** and **Marmaduke Johnson**.
  - **Eliot Bible** (1660), translated into the Natick dialect for local Algonquin tribes.

### **Philadelphia as Print Capital**

- **Philadelphia** surpassed **Boston** as the center of colonial printing by **1770**. Two factors for this:
  1. **Benjamin Franklin** arrived in **1723** and transformed the book trade.
  2. **German immigrants** created demand for German-language press, met by **Christopher Sauer** from the 1730s.
- **Franklin’s Influence**:
  - Revolutionized printing and public learning initiatives, including founding the **Library Company** and **Academy of Philadelphia**.
  - His **Autobiography** offers insight into 18th-century print shops.
- **Common Sense**: In **1776**, Philadelphia printer **Robert Bell** printed hundreds of thousands of copies of **Thomas Paine’s _Common Sense_**, spreading revolutionary ideas.
